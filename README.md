This is the source code for the creation of the 25920 great year music calendar.
Run it in chuck (http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), actually tested on version:	1.3.4.0 (chimera).

Run chuck from command line adding ':' and the fugue's name based on the day it represents.
For example, if you want to run the fugue for the day one you should run the command like this:

    chuck fuguer.ck:1
